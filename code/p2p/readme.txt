// This project is an implementation of a peer-2-peer node designed to work 
// with other nodes to track web page annotations of subscribed users

// The node was deployed on Google App Engine, and all data was stored 
// to a Google Datastore.

// The node makes use of DOM and XSLT since all data transferred is
// in XML format.

// The specification and API for the project was developed collaboratively
// with the aim of a RESTful architecture 

// Wade Tollefson
